# BLOOD BANK APP
This is a medical application which allows registered users (patients) to find and book blood donors nearest to them.
 
- This app is a front-end side of the final Blood Bank project. You can find the back-end app [here](https://github.com/Anny85-code/bloodbankapp-backend).

# [Live Demo]()
 
# Demo Account
 
# Built with
 - React
 - Redux
 - React Router DOM
 - API
 - Tailwind css
 
 
## The learning objective of this project are
 
- Create-react-app (frontend app)
- Connect react frontend app to rails backend
- Use API endpoint to get data
- Fetch data from the API
 
## Getting Started
 
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.
 
### Prerequisites
 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#prerequisites)
 
### Setup
 
- ```git https://github.com/KingsleyIbe/bloodbankapp-frontend.git``
 
- ```cd bloodbankapp-frontend```
 
### Backend Project Repo
[Project Repo](https://github.com/Anny85-code/bloodbankapp-backend.git)
 
### Running The App Locally
 
- Run `npm install`
 
- Make sure to run our [Rails backend application](https://github.com/Anny85-code/bloodbankapp-backend) first before running the React app so that it takes up the `port 3000`. This is very important as our rails API endpoint must run on `port 3000` for the API to work.
- Once the backend is running on `port 3000` then start the react app and you will be prompted to run the server on another port like `port 3001`. You will receive a message in your terminal like this `Would you like to run the app on another port instead? » (Y/n)`. Please enter `y` so that the react app will start on `port 3001`.
